The **Digital SAT** has changed the game. With the Desmos calculator embedded in the entire Math section, students who know how to validly use technology have a massive advantage.

Here are the top strategies you need to know for 2025.

## 1. Plug in Values (The "PITA" Method)

When you see variables in the answer choices, pick a simple number (like 2, 3, or 5) and plug it into the question. Then plug the same number into the answer choices.

> **Tip:** Avoid 0 and 1, as they often have special properties that can make multiple answers look correct.

## 2. Master the Desmos Calculator

You don't just use Desmos for graphing lines. You can use it for:
- Systems of equations (find the intersection)
- Regression (finding the line of best fit)
- Function evaluation

## 3. Work Backwards

For "Find the value of x" questions, start with the middle answer choice (usually B or C). If it's too small, go higher. If too big, go lower. This cuts your work in half.

## 4. Memorize the Few Things You Can't Graph

While Desmos is powerful, you still need to know your:
- Circle Equation: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$
- Exponent Rules
- Special Right Triangles

## 5. Pacing is Key

Don't get stuck on one hard problem. In the adaptive testing model, getting the easy and medium questions right is crucial for your baseline score. Flag the hard ones and come back.
